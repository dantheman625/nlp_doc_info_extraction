## Setup Instructions

> [!NOTE]  
> This is only a Template. And you can add notes, Warnings and stuff with this format style. ([!NOTE], [!WARNING], [!IMPORTANT] )

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-folder]
```

### Create Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project

Follow these notebooks in order:
1. `1_Preprocessing.ipynb` - Data preprocessing
2. `2_Baseline.ipynb` - Establishing a baseline model
3. `3_Training.ipynb` - Model training
4. `4_Evaluation.ipynb` - Evaluating model performance
5. `5_Demo.ipynb` - Demonstration of the final model

You can also run custom scripts located in the `utils/` directory.

---

## Reproducibility

- **Random seeds:** Make sure random seeds are set and noted in your notebooks.
- **Environment:** Include the exact versions of libraries used (already covered by `requirements.txt`).
- **Data:** Clearly state sources of your data and any preprocessing steps.
- **Model Checkpoints:** Provide checkpoints clearly named and explained.
